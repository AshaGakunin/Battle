#Usage

To use this plugin there are a few things to note, this will overwrite two ffxiv macro slots while in use.  Your Individual 0 and 1 macro slots will be over ridden.

To see HP bars you must have false nails equiped and not have on any equipment that hides them from view.

You must not have any Penumbra mods that conflict and modify false nails.  You must also not have any Penumbra mods that modify any abilities nor the /wave and /goodbye emotes.

This mod currently only works in designated places.
